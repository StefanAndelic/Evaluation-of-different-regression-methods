Evaluation of different regression methods and performance metrics in predicting the price of round cut diamonds 

The repository contains Python code for evaluating (e.g. in terms of MSE, RMSE, R-Squared, and MAE) the following regression algorithms (e.g. available within scikit-learn machine learning library) on Diamonds dataset taken from UCI Machine Learning Repository:

(1) linear regression, 
(2) k-neighbors regression, 
(3) Ridge regression, 
(4) decision tree regression, 
(5) random forest regression, 
(6) gradient Boosting regression, 
(7) SGD regression, 
(8) support vector regression (SVR), 
(9) linear SVR, 
(10) multi-layer perceptron regression. 

The code can be executed through CLI by entering the Python script file name followed by a dataset name(e.g. python Regression.py diamonds.csv).Alternatively, the the source code provided in the repository can be imported into a Python IDE(e.g.Eclipse)
